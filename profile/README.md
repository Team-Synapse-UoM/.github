# Team Synapse UoM
## EN3150 Assignment 03

Welcome to Team Synapse UoM's GitHub organization! We are a group of electrical engineering students from the University of Moratuwa, working on the **Pattern Recognition (EN3150) Group Assignment**. Our focus is on deep learning techniques - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.

### Part 1: Custom CNN for Image Classification
---

**Repository:** [Custom-CNN-ImageClassification](https://github.com/Team-Synapse-UoM/Custom-CNN-ImageClassification)

In this project, all four team members collaborated to design and implement a custom CNN model for the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. We followed a structured process to build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

#### Highlights:
- Custom CNN architecture built using Pytorch
- Dataset split into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Parameters tuned for optimal performance.
- Evaluation through accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall.
- Comparisons made with popular architecture.

### Part 2: State-of-the-Art Implementations
---

Each team member has taken the lead in implementing and fine-tuning a specific pre-trained CNN architecture, comparing its performance with the custom model.

### Repositories:
- **[DenseNet Implementation](https://github.com/Team-Synapse-UoM/DenseNet-Implementation)** by [Gayanukaa](https://github.com/Gayanukaa)
    - DenseNet fine-tuned on our dataset to achieve improved accuracy and model convergence.
- **[ResNet Implementation](https://github.com/Team-Synapse-UoM/ResNet-Implementation)** by [Sulith123](https://github.com/Sulith123)  
    - ResNet architecture used to handle deeper layers with residual connections.
- **[GoogLeNet Implementation](https://github.com/Team-Synapse-UoM/GoogLeNet-Implementation)** by [nimeshlal097](https://github.com/nimeshlal097)
    - Fine-tuning of GoogLeNet for complex image classification.
- **[VGG Implementation](https://github.com/Team-Synapse-UoM/VGG-Implementation)** by [SandaruDias](https://github.com/SandaruDias)
    - VGG architecture optimized to extract more features from the dataset.

Each repository includes:
- Code for loading and fine-tuning the pre-trained models.
- Comparisons between fine-tuned models and the custom CNN.
<!-- - Training scripts with different hyperparameters. -->
